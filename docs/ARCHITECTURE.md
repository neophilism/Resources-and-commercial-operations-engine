# Resource operations boundary

A budget uses explicit integer units: minor currency units, provider credits, tokens or another deployment-defined measure. Different units are never silently converted. Reserving capacity reduces available funds before an operation is attempted. Effects move through held, committed, uncertain, settled or released states. Idempotent reservation keys reject changed terms and duplicate effect keys.

Unattempted reservations may expire. Committed/uncertain effects keep their reservation until a receipt or proof of no charge resolves them. Unexpected real charges require explicit human-owner reconciliation; over-limit accounting is preserved and prevents new reservations. Each transition returns a new serializable state and a hash-chained cost event. Allocation records must balance exactly.

The library uses an explicit authenticated operator allowlist and scope/purpose checks. A durable adapter must serialize concurrent transitions and store the returned state and effects transactionally. The current package does not create bank transactions, invoices, payment gateways or a commercial product catalogue. The scoped durable budget adapter is documented in [DURABILITY.md](DURABILITY.md); its database and receipt ports require deployment configuration. Permission/license decisions remain a separate engine. Source references do not by themselves authenticate external receipts.

Command replays check current stored budget membership, exact reservation principal/purpose and any required owner role before returning cached historical acknowledgements. The original command fingerprint is retained; cached data is not an execution permit or fresh provider attestation. Trusted host identity context remains required.

Disposable PostgreSQL17 CI tests qualify specific reservation, consumption, lost-acknowledgement and observed-lock cached-authorization scenarios. These are separate from PGlite evidence and do not qualify production identity/receipt services, TLS/failover or deployment. See POSTGRES_TESTS.md.

Immutable settled-cost allocation records exact balanced project/contributor cells with historical source edition/receipt/cost-chain links and atomic audit/outbox in the Resources-owned DB. Accepted PR7 passed32 ordinary and five PostgreSQL17 groups; accepted PR8 added the sixth database-role/RLS boundary group without runtime changes. See ALLOCATIONS.md and POSTGRES_TESTS.md.

Explicit private corrections append up to64 immutable original/predecessor-bound editions, preserving all prior allocations/charges/capacity. Current manager/operator/purpose/source checks precede cached historical acknowledgement, with no reset/deletion or effect authority. Ten restricted-migration groups also pass installed compiled exports; all42 ordinary local tests/typecheck/build/registry and strict integration compile pass. Source6027cbbe4f4bc11678e8fcfdd61f38d8df18f23c CI40740920672 passes42 ordinary and seven actual PostgreSQL17 groups including observed public correction contention/lost COMMIT acknowledgement/fresh-pool replay; logs inspected. Final-head acceptance remains separate. See ALLOCATION_CORRECTIONS.md.

These are private bookkeeping interfaces, not independent receipt/contributor entitlement/accounting qualification, payments, exports or external Identity/action fences. Trusted host current authentication/configuration/database limits and production TLS/failover/throughput/crash/deployment services remain required.

Private accounting statements now join original charge and current effective allocation cells in one locked owning SQL observation, with exact original/latest correction/observed budget references and no new bookkeeping effect. Initial test evidence and remaining qualification: ALLOCATION_STATEMENT.md.
